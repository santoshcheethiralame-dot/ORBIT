plan generator - the main brain
it generates the daily study plan accounting for all the user inputs
1. if esa day -  4 units , multiple prep days for the exam, and completely theroretical questions(100marks) , so a lot of studying and revising
2. if isa day - 2 units, 0.5-1 prep day, major chunk from MCQs(24 marks, usually veryy tricky ) and a lil theory ( very direct and 16 marks )
3. if holiday - be extra regerous from morning itself with a couple of breaks for food and relaxation ( be generous )
4. if bunked - same as holiday but just a little less to cover up the classes he missed THAT day  ( no need to cover up classes if bunked during isa/esa )
5. if sick - be veryy light but not completely nill
but no matter what the project should be alloted some time everyday ( normal days depending on how much time it takes, 1/3rd of it on esa days and sick/assignment days, none on isas)

4. daily goal  stat - how much of daily blocks are completed ( hours or blocks )
4. a daily streak thing
5. a pending assignment card or previous day's rollback subject blocks if any
