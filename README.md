> **Mission Control for Students. An energy-aware, local-first study execution system built for those who don't live by rigid calendars.**

---

## 🧠 The Philosophy: Context over Calendar

Traditional planners fail because they assume every day is the same. **Orbit** is built on the reality of student life: inconsistent energy, late-night study streaks, and shifting academic priorities.

### 🌌 The Night-Owl Principle
Most planners reset at midnight—breaking your flow. Orbit features a **configurable day-start threshold** (default: 4:00 AM). Studying at 3:30 AM still counts as "today," preserving your focus streaks and mental momentum.

## 🏗 System Architecture

Orbit utilizes a **Local-First Architecture**, ensuring 100% offline functionality and zero-latency interactions by keeping the entire database on the client side.

## 🚀 Core Systems

### 1. Daily Context Engine
Every day begins with a **Calibration Step**. Instead of a static schedule, you feed the engine your current reality:
*   **Energy Level**: Low / Normal / High
*   **Day Type**: Normal / ISA (Internal) / ESA (External)
*   **Conditions**: Holiday, sick, or unexpected workload.

### 2. Adaptive Displacement Planner
Orbit’s engine converts your context into variable study blocks using a multi-factor prioritization system:
*   **Project Decay Detection**: Automatically escalates subjects neglected for 3+ days.
*   **Exam Proximity**: Dynamically increases "Dominance Priority" as deadlines approach.
*   **Workload Analysis**: Visualizes 4 levels of load (Light to Extreme) with overload warnings.

### 3. Focus Session Protocol
A tactile, distraction-free environment for execution.
*   **State Preservation**: Pause and resume without losing progress.
*   **Microinteractions**: Woodblock tap audio (300Hz) and glass chime success alerts.
*   **Session Reflections**: Integrated glass-morphism notes for immediate feedback capture.

### 4. Enhanced Intelligence Layer (v3)
The new `Brain v3` update introduces human-centric optimizations:
*   **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA)**: Detects if subjects are too easy/hard and auto-tunes block durations.
*   **Energy Budgeting**: Prevents burnout by matching task intensity to your daily energy profile.
*   **Burnout Protection**: Silently monitors skip rates and mood streaks to suggest recovery days.
